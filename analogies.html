    Ren Asic: switch the letters around to form arsenic [r e n a s i c]
    </p>
    <p>Ren's 75 characteristics: the approximate atomic number of arsenic
    </p>
    <p>Ren's 33 "mental" features: The 33 protons that make up arsenic. "Mental" features represent protons because your mental features are what defines you as for an element the protons define it in the table of elements.
    </p>
    <p>Ren's 42 physical appearances: The 42 neurons that are located in the nucleus of arsenic.
    </p>
    <p>Ren's captors/The Voices: The 33 electrons in arsenic. In the story, the voices are negative influences, telling Ren to do bad things. Since elements have a negative charge, this makes sense that they are negative or evil.
    </p>
    <p>The body: The nucleus. In the story, the body of each "person" is made up of their "mental" and "physical" features, which are the protons and the neutrons.
    </p>
    <p>Ren's blond hair: the yellow form of Arsenic is more unstable than its other forms. This explains Ren's psychopathic behavior. When unstable elements become stable, they lose neutrons and protons. When the story starts off, Ren is stable and the Voices are gone, but one of his "mental" characteristics, his good memory, has disappeared. However, at the end of the story, Ren gains his memory back and is yet again unstable.
    </p>
    <p>The 18 first men: The 18 groups in the periodic table. They each had "children," those "children" being the elements in each group.
    </p>
    <p>The bright explosion of light and sound: The big bang was believed to be the force that produced the first atoms.
    </p>
    <p>Arsonist: Ren was an arsenist because the words arsenic and arsonist are very close in sound. Arsenic is also often used in the production of bombs and poison gases.
