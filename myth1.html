    <p>Ren Asic squinted into the bright light of the midday sun. He could feel its rays from behind the glass of his bedroom window. He was 33 years old. He had a job, unlike most of the people in district 15. There were 18 districts and they were all inside the walls of Conductor City. Ren’s job was to construct bombs at the local factory in town. He liked his job, it was peaceful there. He tried not to think about what would happen to his bombs when they were finished. 
<br>Bob Bismuth was the mayor of district 15. He was an old man with dark hair and rough voice. He liked helping people. Ren wished he were as rich and powerful as Bob but he was only a middle class citizen. Ren’s aunt Imony lived in district 15 too, she was middle class, like him. Nick Nitro and Philly Phos were Ren’s neighbors. They were lower class citizens. Ren frequently brought food to them to help them out. 
<br>Ren stepped away from his window. He glanced in the mirror. His red eyes drifted up towards his blond scraggly hair. He lifted him hand to smooth it down. He sighed. His house was a three-room apartment on the third floor of the town center building. Ren liked the view from there but it was rather displeasing to have to walk up and down the stairs every morning and every afternoon on his way to and from work. 
<br>Ren opened the top drawer on his dresser. He ran his hand on the cool surface of the drawer. He fingers touched something smooth. He grabbed it. It was his old coin collection book. Is father had given it to him when he was young. He flipped through the pages. He only needed three more spots for this set. Ren closed the book. He knew what he was going to do today. He knew how he could make his life better. He would collect all the coins in the set and show them to his father. Then he would take them to the back and cash them in. Ren smiled and tucked the book under his arm. His laced his shoes and left his apartment, locking the door behind him.
<br>Ren took the train to a suburb, called Actinia, in district 3. The other train lines had been cut off. He wanted to travel to the district closest to his but before he could purchase his ticket a man came up and told him the train had run into a few cows on the tracks and was canceled. Ren was unhappy but he smiled and thanked the man anyway.
<br>Actinia was a nightmarish place, Ren thought as he got off the train. The halls in the station were desolate and bare save a few dark figures lurking in the corners, last week’s newspaper shielding their faces from view. Ren walked down to the entrance. Outside he could see a man walking about in a grey trench coat. Ren approached the man. His face was meek but he had lines drawn in between his brows from years of squinting, he guessed. 
<br>“Excuse me, sir.” Ren said to the man. “Do you know where I can find three coins?” The man stared blankly at him. The he grinned.
<br>“I’m late.” He said
<br>“Late for what?” Ren asked
<br>“I’m late. They’re coming.”
<br>“Who’s coming?” Ren was concerned. 
<br>The man laughed hysterically. “The dolls.” He said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. “They’re coming. They’re going to eat you. Oh,” He gasped suddenly. “It’s time for my medicine.” The man turned around, facing the tall building above them. “Hi, I’m Uranius.” He said to the air.
<br>Ren backed away slowly, he had never met someone who was crazy like that. Ren jumped as a car whizzed by him, only missing him by nearly an inch. Ren turned around. The driver of the car that had almost run him over stuck his hand out of the window and dropped three coins. I guess he doesn’t want them, Ren thought to himself.
<br>Ren picked up the coins. It was exactly the three he needed. Ren smiled as he put them in his book. They fit perfectly. He raced back to his home district. He could not wait to show them to his father in the retirement home and then go to the bank to see how much he had earned. Maybe it would be enough to buy a house instead of his old apartment on the third floor.
<br>Ren ran through the doors of the retirement home. Old folks glanced at him then returned to their work. Ren turned the corner. He knew where his father usually sat. He burst through the door. His father turned around.
<br>“Father,” Ren said, pulling the book of coins from his backpack. “Look I found them all.”
<br>His father laughs and tells him, “Didn’t you know Ren? Those were all fake.”
