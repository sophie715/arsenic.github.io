    <h1 style="text-align:center"><font color="blue">What is an atom?</font></h1>
    <p>
    The atom is made up of subatomic particles. These particles are called electrons, protons, and neutrons. protons and neutrons make up the majority of the atom's mass and are contained and
     compressed in the center of the atom. Protons are positive and neutrons are neutral. Electrons are located outside the nucleus in an area called the
    electron cloud. Electrons make up most of the space of the atom, or the volume. electrons have a negative charge. As a result of the charges,
    the nucleus is always positive and the electron cloud is always negative. When an atom has more or less neutrons than protons it is called an 
    isotope. When an atom has a different number of electrons than protons, it is called an ion. The number of protons in an atom are called the atomic number.
    The protons and neutrons are added to find the atomic mass. When there are more electrons than protons, the atom has a negative charge, however, 
    when there are more protons than electrons, the atom has a positive charge. the molar mass is the sum of the total mass in grams of all the atoms that 
    make up a molecule per mole. It is measured in grams per mole.

    <h1 style="text-align:center"><font color="blue">Atomic Orbitals</font></h1>
    <p>An orbit is a definite path around something that can be plotted. An orbital is not necessarily an orbit but it functions as one. An orbital is the 
    predicted space around the nucleus that an electron may be traveling. The orbital of an electron can be found with quantum numbers. There are
    four types of orbitals:</p>
    <p style="text-indent:50px">
    <b>S</b> - A circular-shaped orbit around the nucleus
	</p>
    <p style="text-indent:50px">
    <b>P</b> - An infinity-sign-shaped orbit around the nucleus
    </p><p style="text-indent:50px">
    <b>D</b> - A four-leaf-clover-shaped orbit around the nucleus
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent:50px">
    <b>F</b> - A hexagonal-lobe-shaped orbit around the nucleus
    </p>
    <p> Energy levels of atomic orbitals range from 1 to infinity. The first energy level is the orbit closest to the nucleus. The level contains only
    two electrons and has the lowest energy. As the energy levels get higher, 
    they become farther from the nucleus and require more energy to move up to. </p>
    
    <h1 style="text-align:center"><font color="blue">Discovery of Arsenic</font></h1>
    <p>Arsenic was first considered to be discovered by Albert the Great (Albertus Magnus, 1193-1280). In De Mineralibus, he described how heating a common compound of arsenic, 
    orpiment, with soap would allow the metal to be obtained. Nearly pure arsenic was formed in the process. He was the first to state that arsenic has a metal-like nature. However, it has been known throughout history in its sulfide compound, 
    meaning it is impossible to tell for sure when it was really discovered. Greek philosopher Aristotle, in the fourth century BC, refers to 
    “sandarach” renamed arhenicum by his student Theophrastus of Eresos. Greek historian Olympiodorus of Thebes (5th century AD) roasted arsenic 
    sulfide and obtained white arsenic (As2O3). <br><br>
    Arsenic is a metalloid. In metallic form it is bright, silver-grey, and brittle. The name <i>arsenic</i> is thought to come from <i>arsenikon</i>, the Greek name for the yellow pigment orpiment.
    The two most common allotropes of arsenic are yellow, which does not conduct electricity, and metallic grey, which does conduct electricity.</p>
    
    <h1 style="text-align:center"><font color="blue">Uses of Arsenic</font></h1>
    <p style="text-indent:50px">- Rat poison</p>
    <p style="text-indent:50px">- Insecticides</p>
    <p style="text-indent:50px">- Medical applications: Dr. Fowler's Solution (potassium arsenate) was a popular cure-all tonic that was even
    used by Charles Dickens.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:50px">- Organoarsenic compounds are added to poultry feed to prevent disease and improve weight gain.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:50px">- Doping agent in semiconductors for solid-state devices</p>
    <p style="text-indent:50px">- Used to make special glass and preserve wood</p>
    <p style="text-indent:50px">- Used in bombs and poison gases</p>
    <p style="text-indent:50px">- Used in assassinations throughout history</p>
    <p style="text-indent:50px">- Used in ammunition manufacturing to create harder and rounder bullets</p>
