    Ren Asic – switch the letters around to form arsenic
<br><br>Ren’s age – the number of protons in arsenic
<br><br>District 15 – The 15th group in the periodic table where arsenic is found
<br><br>18 Districts – The 18 groups in the periodic table
<br><br>Ren’s job – One of arsenic’s uses is to make bombs
<br><br>Class system – Metals are the upper class, metalloids are the middle class, and nonmetals are lower class; Ren is middle class because arsenic is a metalloid
<br><br>Bob Bismuth – The element bismuth. It is “mayor” because it is a metal
<br><br>Aunt Imony – The element antimony. It is middle class because it is a metalloid
<br><br>Nick Nitro – The element nitrogen. It is lower class because it is a nonmetal
<br><br>Philly Phos – The element phosphorus. It is lower class because it is a nonmetal
<br><br>Blond hair – Ren has blond hair because one of the most common allotropes of arsenic has a yellow pigment
<br><br>The coin collection – The electrons; Ren needs three more to fill his set because arsenic had five valence electrons and requires two more to have a completed energy level
<br><br>Uranius – The element uranium. Since uranium is a bid unstable, so is Uranius
<br><br>Actinia – The actinide series where Uranium is found
