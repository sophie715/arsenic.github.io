    	<p>NASA announced Thursday it has discovered alien life in California's Mono
    		Lake, bacteria that use arsenic instead of phosphorus in its DNA. All life 
    		discovered so far from teeny amoebas to enormous elephants, are composed of 
    		the same six elements: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus.
    		But Felisa Wolfe-Simon, a scientist at Arizona State University's School of Earth 
    		and Space Exploration, found a strain of Halomonadaceae bacteria called GFAJ-1 on 
    		the bottom of California's volcanic Mono Lake that can live without any phosphorus.
    		Instead, when deprived of phosphorus, instead of dying, it uses arsenic to build cells.
    	</p>
    	<p>NASA planetary scientist Pamela Conrad compared it to the classic Star Trek 
    		episode about discovering a cave-dwelling lifeform based on silicon instead of 
    		carbon. "This is the equivalent of finding that Horta," Conrad said. "This is a huge deal!"

    	Plutonium, a young and new recruit to the Actinide terrorist group in Wesern F Block Nation, is having "second thoughts" about his
    	destiny in the group, reports confirm. The young element, commonly referred to as Pluto is experiencing PTSD, a common disorder for 
    	elements in these types of conditions. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	"PTSD stands for post traumatic stress disorder and usually results in these elements becoming unstable." Psycologist for the Silicon Valley
    	concludes. "Not that they aren't already unstable, being a suicide bomber and all."
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	Pluto's co-conspirators gently calm him down by singing him tunes of the common childhood song <i>Ring-a-round the nucleus</i>. "It goes something
    	like this," The psycologist says. "Ring-a-round the nucleus.."

    	<p>Late last night Tin finally concluded his research concerning why he rusts. "It was a long a hard task." Tin told reporters, eager
    	to share his discovery. "When I found out I immediately ran to my father to tell him the good news!"
    	</p>
    	<p>When reporters asked Tin how he managed to figure it out, he chuckled. "Well," He said. "I spent hours watching documentaries that 
    	have to do with tin and then it came to me. I just had to follow the yellow brick road!"</p>
    	<br>
    	<p>Tin told reporters this morning,"I suggest you all follow the yellow brick road to success." Then he added blissfully. "Just
    	make sure you don't go looking for the gold pot at the end of the rainbow."

    	<p>It was late one day. The street dogs had crawled away and the rats had come about. The wind howled longingly in the 
    	cool autumn air. I was just finishing up my late night shift when I saw it happen. Just off the coast, about a hundred miles out, the lights
    	on the Titanium went out. I held my breath, thinking back to the Titanic. The Titanium was a much better, much stronger boat. It was
    	unsinkable!</p>
    	<p>I grabbed my hat and raced to the end of the dock. The water was far to cold to swim in. I jumped in my motor boat and drove as quickly 
    	as I could toward the sinking ship. It took me awhile to finally get there. When I did, I could not look. I was too late, they were
    	all dead.</p>
    	<p>It was truly awful. I hope I never have to see anything like it again. I guess its back to the drawing board for Titanium 2.0.</p>

    	<p>Hillary Calcium began her career in political science at the age of 23. She new she wanted to be a representative for the district of
    	Californium. She knew she wanted to be a billionaire. But she also knew she could do better. She wanted to become the president.</p>
    	<p>She started off her campaign in the small, barren land of Uranium. It was a poor area, many people there were impoverished and
    	could not read nor write. But Calcium wanted to go there anyway. She thought it would show her support for even the poorest and 
    	most dirtiest of Americiums. Her campaign was set for that Tuesday and when she got up to speak, all the citizens of Uranium 
    	listened.</p>
    	<p>Calcium's success in the lower parts of Americium have proven a great success. "I feel so good helping people." She told the reporters.
    	"They seem to be a lot better off and they want to vote for me too."</p>
    	<p>"It's a good strategy." Donald Thorium told the press. "If you know you aren't going to win over the rich like I am, then go to the poor! There's more of them and they barely understand
    	English so all you have to do is smile and they will listen to you."</p>
