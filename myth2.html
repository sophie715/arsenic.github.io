    <h1 style="text-align:center"><b>The Tale of Ren Asic<b></h1>
    <br>
    <p><i>
    At first there was only darkness. Then time folded in on itself and in a bright explosion of light and sound there was man. 
    There were 18, floating through space.  They opened their eyes and saw the world for the first time. Years passed and they 
    each had children, some more than others but each child was different than their brothers and their sisters. They each had 
    certain characteristics, parts of their soul spread out around them. Those that remained separate from their bodies were the 
    bad ones, the evil ones. They called them the Voices, for they talked to the child and made them do things. They were the 
    actions and thoughts and emotions that made fire burn in their eyes. So they were cast away, yet still remained close. 
    Inside of each child was the good part of their souls, they stayed, compacted into their body’s tissue, surrounded and protected. 
    They made up the body and the Voices, their souls.
    </i></p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Ren Asic opened his eyes. He moaned, draping his arm over his eyes to block out the light shining through his window. 
    He turned over in his head, stretching out an arm to grab his alarm clock. His hand fell through empty space. Ren rubbed his eyes. 
    His alarm clock was gone. His desk was gone. His whole apartment was gone. Ren looked around. He was lying on a small rotting pier 
    by a large river. The water flowed quietly down the hilly landscape. Ren liked the quiet. He never really knew when it was coming 
    nor how long it would last but it was the only time he could think straight. But only now, he realized, he could not remember anything 
    that had happened to him in the past few months. <i>That’s odd</i>, he thought. <i>I have a good memory</i>.
    <br>
    <br>
	Ren had seventy five characteristics. Thirty three were mental features and forty two were physical appearances, like his red eyes 
	and blond hair. Ren’s friends had some of the same characteristics he had, but none of them had exactly the same. Ren’s favorites 
	were his ability to run fast, his intelligence, and his dark sense of humor. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Ren stood up. His clothes were dirty. He rubbed his hands down his shirt. They were black. Ren started to get worried, did he even 
    still have an apartment? He walked down the pier and placed his hands in the water. The black dust washed off in puffs of gray clouds. 
    Ren heard a twig snap behind him. He turned around.
    <br>
    <br>
	“What are you doing here?” A man stepped up to the dock. “You can’t be here. This is private property.”
	<br>
	<br>
	Ren lifted his hands out of the water. “I’m sorry,” He said. “I didn’t know.”
	<br>
	<br>
	The man rolled his eyes. “You’re going to have to come with me.” He said. He took Ren by the arm and together they marched up the hill. 
	Ren asked a lot of question on the way to the house at the top of the hill. The man did not answer any of them. Ren was starting to get 
	angry. He was angry not just at the man who would not answer any of his questions, but also at himself for not remembering how he got 
	himself into this mess. He knew he must have a reasonable explanation.
	<br>
	<br>
	Ren opened his mouth to say something, but the man had stopped walking. He looked over his shoulder. The man’s eyes rolled back in his 
	head and he crumpled to the ground. There was a small pool of blood forming around the back of his neck. Ren suddenly felt sick. 
	<br>
	<br>
	There was a girl with dark black hair standing behind the man. She had a smug look on her face. Ren’s eyes moved down to the knife in 
	her hand. His eyes widened. 
	<br>
	<br>
	“W-what are you doing?” He stammered.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
    The girl laughed. “Helping you out.”
    <br>
    <br>
	Ren bent down to the man lying on the grass. He felt for a pulse. His throat went dry. He could not feel anything. 
	<br>
	<br>
	“He’s dead.” Ren said softly.
	<br>
	<br>
	The girl look at him. Her eyes were black. That scared him. Whenever he looked at her all he could see was his reflection. Her skin was 
	pale white and her black hair fell in straight lines down her face. 
	<br>
	<br>
	“We’re late.” She said. “They’re waiting for us.”
	<br>
	<br>
	“They who?” Ren cried. “What are <i>we</i> late for?” The girl sighed and pulled a long rope out of her bag.
	<br>
	<br>
	“I hate having to do this.” She said. She grabbed Ren’s shoulder and bound his hands behind his back. 
	<br>
	<br>
	“No, stop!” he screamed. “Why are you doing this?” The girl did not answer. She knelt beside her bag and pulled out a cloth. Ren turned 
	his head, looking for a way to escape. He called out. The girl hissed at him. He called again. The girl got mad. She put her hand over 
	his mouth. With her other hand she picked up the cloth and put it in his mouth. It tasted bitter. She tied it behind the back of his head.
	<br>
	<br>
	Ren had been gagged and bound and now he was being held captive, marching up the hill to who-knows-where. As they got closer to the house 
	at the top of the hill, his heart began to beat faster. He wondered what was waiting for him there. Maybe they would kill him. Maybe they 
	wanted something from him. He did not know.
	<br>
	<br>
	The door to the house opened. A man stepped out. He was tall and had pale white skin, like the girl. His hair was thick and black and his 
	eyes were like coal.
	<br>
	<br>
	“Jack,” The girl said, addressing the man. “He’s here.” The girl pushed him forward to the man. Ren tried to scream but with the cloth in 
	his mouth all he could really do was mumble. They pushed him inside the house and tied him to a chair in the dining room. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The girl went away and got a can of gasoline. Ren tried to yank his hands free from the ropes binding him to the chair but they were too 
	tight. More people came into the house. They were dressed just like his two captors. They all looked the same with thick black hair, dark 
	coal eyes, and pale white skin. 
	<br>
	<br>
	He counted them. There were thirty three. Ren was scared. He knew he would not be able to escape, not with all these people here to stop 
	him. Ren closed his eyes. He did not want to see anymore, he did not want to hear anymore, he just wanted it to be over. 
	<br>
	<br>
	“Wake up.” A man yelled into his face. He slapped the back of Ren’s head. Ren groaned. “You don’t want to miss this part.” The man said.
	<br>
	<br>
	Ren looked up. He heard another man screaming down the hall. He squinted. Two of them were dragging a chair towards him. There was a brown 
	haired man in it. His eyes widened when he saw Ren. The man behind him took the cloth out of his mouth.
	<br>
	<br>
	“Let me go.” Ren said. “Let me go and I swear I won’t say anything.” His captors laughed. Ren’s heart sank. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    The girl who had originally brought him to the house pulled out a lighter from her pocket. She flipped the lid off and a small flame burned 
    from her fingertips. Ren turned to the brown haired man bound to the chair in front of him. The man looked at him.
    <br>
    <br>
	“Why.” He said, his voice was hoarse. “Why are you doing this?” Ren looked up. The girl tipped the flame and lit the curtains on the windows 
	on fire. They burst into flames. The whole wall groaning with the heat. It spread quickly down to the floor and the carpet. Some of Ren’s 
	captors were on fire, he realized. He wondered why they were still here, why they were letting themselves burn. Ren’s heart beat louder 
	than he ever could have imagined. He jumped and kicked and yanked his arms, but the rope was tight. He scooted the chair away from the 
	flames, back into a wall. The fire spread to the ceiling, engulfing the chandelier in flames. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Ren heard a crack. The chandelier tipped towards him and with a loud moan broke away from the ceiling. Pieces flew everywhere. The glass 
	hit the floor, spraying debris and glass shards everywhere. A piece hit Ren’s leg. He gasped. He could feel blood running down his ankle.
	<br>
	<br>
	Ren yanked his arms again. The rope snapped. A piece of the chandelier must have hit it. Ren rubbed his wrists. He looked for the man but 
	he could not find him. Fire blazed around him. Ren stood up. He gasped and collapsed on the floor. His leg stung. He grabbed the shard of 
	glass and twisted it out of his leg. He cried out. The pain boiled up inside him. 
	<br>
	<br>
	He had to get out. He had to leave before the house burned down. Ren noticed his captors were gone. He leaped for the kitchen. There was a 
	door there. It had been the door they came in from. He grabbed the handle. It burnt his fingers but he held on anyway. He twisted the knob.
	 It would not move. Ren stepped back then slammed his shoulder into the door. It flew open. Ren tumbled out. He coughed. The smoke had made
	 its way into his lungs.
	<br>
	<br>
	Ren pushed himself up and began running towards the road to the north of the house. He needed help. He glanced over his shoulder and his 
	heart skipped a beat. His captors were chasing him. He picked up his pace. It was hard to run with his leg like this.
	<br>
	<br>
	He ran into the street. He looked over his shoulder again. They were closer. Ren heard the screech of a car. He looked back in front of him. 
	A woman in a black Sedan rolled her window down.
	<br>
	<br>
	“Get out of the road!” She screamed at him. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Ren looked over his shoulder again. “You have to help me.” He said, his voice quivering. “They’re chasing me! They’re coming. They’ll kill 
	me!” He cried.
	<br>
	<br>
	The woman glanced over in the direction he was pointing. She looked confused.
	<br>
	<br>
	“Are you feeling alright?” She asked him. He shook his head. What kind of question was that? Of course he was not alright. There were people
	 who were going to kill him.
	<br>
	<br>
	“No,” He says. “They’re going to kill me. They are right there.” 
	<br>
	<br>
	The lady shakes her head. She begins to feel a little uncomfortable. “There’s nobody there.” She says quietly. Suddenly Ren remembers. 
	He remembers what happened yesterday, and the day before, and all the days before that.    
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    The lady’s radio turned on. The low static voice repeats its message over and over again. The lady’s face turns white.
    <br>
    <br>
	“Be on the lookout for Ren Asic, a tall middle-aged man with blond hair and red eyes. He is a psychopathic serial arsonist and has 
	murdered eighteen people in the past two months.” Ren looks over his shoulder. The black haired, dark eyed people are gone, back into his 
	head where they belong. He smiles to himself and chuckles softly, turning the lighter over and over in his pocket.
